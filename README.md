PathFinder is a web application that visualizes Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm, allowing users to find the shortest route from a starting point to a destination on a grid. Users can interactively block roads (by clicking on grid cells) to simulate obstacles, and the algorithm dynamically recalculates the shortest path while avoiding these blocked paths. It provides a real-time visual representation of how Dijkstra’s algorithm explores the grid and determines the optimal route. Ideal for learning and demonstration purposes, PathFinder showcases how graph-based pathfinding works in a visually engaging and interactive way.
